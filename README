To pull down any docker images that are required based on 'docker-compose.yml'
$ docker-compose pull

To start the project
$ docker-compose up

$ curl localhost:5000

To stop the services
$ docker-compose stop

A shortcut for 'build', 'pull' and 'up' & run in background (-d flag)
$ docker-compose up --build -d

To list all containers for the project
$ docker-compose ps

To tail the log output

To restart all containers
$ docker-compose restart
To restart specific services
$ docker-compose restart <service names> 

To execute a command on a particular container
$ docker-compose exec web ls -la

To get into the shell of certain container
